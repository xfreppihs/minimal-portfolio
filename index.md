([presentation](https://youtu.be/mn9afg52erY))([report](pdf/team032report.pdf))
- Led a team of 6 to build a content-based interactive recommender system using weighted cosine similarity
- Scraped, merged, and cleaned ~30,000 US cities data with ~80 attributes from three different data sources
- Imputed missing values with k-nearest neighbors (KNN) and performed k-means clustering to evaluate data quality

([report](pdf/house_report.pdf))

- Scraped and cleaned ~1,000 local house price data from Zillow.com
- Built regularized linear regression (Lasso and Ridge) and random forest regression models to predict sales prices
- Performed feature engineering using natural language processing (NLP) and improved prediction mean squared error by 9%

- Used four parameter logistic to study a dose-response curve and calculate the IC50/ED50/EC50 dose ([R](projects/drc_4PL.html))
- Used linear-quadratic and multi-target to model cell survival curve after radiation ([R](projects/nls_lq_mt.html) &#124; [python](projects/curve_fit_lq_mt.html))
- Used exponential decay increasing to the max to fit a (pseudo) first-order reaction ([R](projects/nls_exponential_decay_increasing_to_max.html) &#124; [python](projects/curve_fit_exponential_decay_increasing_to_max.html))

([slides](projects/correlation_analysis.html))
- Analyzed correlations between redox-related metabolites in head and neck cancer patients and their responses to a cancer treatment
- Built a multiple linear regression model using the forward selection based on adjusted R<sup>2</sup> method

([kaggle notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/iamanalien/atp-tennis-2000-2020-initial-analysis))
- Analyzed over 63,000 men’s professional tennis matches from 2000 to 2020
- Examined the statistics on upset rate and the impact of winning the first set on the whole match
- Created interactive visualizations for top players’ ranking and performance comparisons
